US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have agreed to work together on steps to counter North Korea's nuclear and missile development, ahead of the US leader's visit to Asia, according the Japanese government.
In a 20-minute phone call, Mr Trump and Mr Abe discussed the schedule of the president's coming visit, which includes a 5-7 November stop in Japan, and agreed to remain in close contact over North Korea, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters.
Mr Trump told the Japanese leader that "he is looking forward to his visit to Japan, that Japan and America are 100% together and there is no room to doubt the Japan-US alliance," Mr Nishimura said.
"They agreed to deepen their discussions on the North Korean situation and other matters" during Mr Trump's visit, he said.
It comes after senior officials from the US, Japan and South Korea urged North Korea to walk away from its "destructive and reckless path" of weapons development, according to a US military statement.
The three powers held trilateral talks over North Korea's recent long-range ballistic missile and nuclear tests.
Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford hosted his South Korean and Japanese counterparts at the US Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.
"Together they called upon North Korea to refrain from irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tensions, and to walk away from its destructive and reckless path of development," the statement said.
Meanwhile the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministers are to meet in Beijing tomorrow in what is an extension of yesterdayâ€™s talks.
The meeting will be the first since the two officials took office.
The officials will exchange analyses on the current situation regarding North Korea's nuclear and missile programme and also discuss ways to cooperate in managing the situation in a stable manner, the statement said.
