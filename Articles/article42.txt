Police arrest 27-year-old after the grisly discovery was made during a search for a missing 23-year-old woman  A Japanese man has been arrested after nine bodies and two severed heads, some of them stored in picnic coolers, were found in his apartment.
Police made the grisly find in the apartment in Zama, a city just outside Tokyo, after investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman who went missing earlier this month.
The woman had been seen walking with the man near the apartment on security camera footage, multiple media sites reported.
A number of coolers were found in the house, each containing body parts, and led to the arrest of 27-year-old Takahiro Shiraishi on suspicion of abandoning a body.
Police are investigating further, reports said.
According to Jiji Press, police found the two heads inside a cool box at the entrance of the apartment on Monday before making the grisly discovery of the other bodies inside on Tuesday.
A spokesman for the National Police Agency declined to confirm the reports, saying nothing had been officially announced.
