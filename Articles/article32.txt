Pakistan Super League (PSL) management and franchises’ owners have decided to play PSL final in Lahore, which is scheduled to be held on March 5.
The key decision came after a meeting held in Dubai on Monday between PSL management and the owners of team franchises.
Chairman PSL Najam Sethi has also invited Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the COAS General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Chief Minsters of all provinces to the PSL final in Lahore.
“PSL management and franchisees resolve to hold Final in Lahore.
We invite PM, COAS and CMs to attend the match at Gadafi Stadium,” Sethi tweeted on Monday.
However PSL management is yet to announce when PSL Final tickets will be available to purchase.
