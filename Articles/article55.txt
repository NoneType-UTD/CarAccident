Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja  About N1tn gas flare penalty that is meant for communities in the Niger Delta is being withheld by the Federal Government, the Centre for Peace and Environmental Justice, a civil society organisation, has alleged.
According to CEPEJ, the Federal Government has refused to release the fund because the communities have been calm and have not agitated for the money.
This is coming as the Independent Service Delivery Monitoring Group accused international oil companies operating in Nigeria of failing to pay gas flare penalties amounting to over N2.3tn.
Speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Monday to announce its forthcoming annual conference tagged: ‘Edo 2017,’ the National Coordinator, CEPEJ, Mr. Sherriff Mulade, stated that the three per cent statutory levy paid by oil companies to the Niger Delta Development Commission over the years had not been utilised for the benefit of the region and had been diverted by politicians in most cases.
“On the gas flare penalties paid to the Federal Government, amounting to about N1tn, we are shocked that up till this moment, no part of this money has been released to the communities.”
