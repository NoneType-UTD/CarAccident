By EUOBSERVER  Despite Brexit, Danish energy minister Lars Christian Lilleholt announced an agreement on Monday to build the world's longest DC power cable, the Viking Link, connecting Danish and UK grids via the North Sea.
The cable will make it possible for Denmark to increase electricity exports to the UK.
At the same time, Denmark will also increase imports through a new connection to Germany.
