A former public school boy convicted of plotting to assassinate Vladimir Putin has been injured and his wife killed in an ambush shooting outside Kiev.
Adam Osmaev, 36, a who was born in what is now Russia's Chechnya republic and studied at Wycliffe College in the Cotswolds, was injured but will live after his car was hit with gunshots from the bushes at a railroad crossing in the Kiev region, according to Anton Geraschenko, MP and aide to Ukraine's interior minister.
He had fought for Kiev as a battalion commander in the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Mr Osmaev's wife Amina Okueva was killed in the attack, however, Mr Geraschenko said.
“The best commemoration of her will be a just reprisal against all those who were involved in this horrible murder,” he wrote in a Facebook post.
